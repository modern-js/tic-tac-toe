React official tutorial (Tic tac toe game with a different implementation)
YouTube - a couple of videos about react and the game logic
PluralSight - I got the idea for the winner algorithm from a tutorial
Medium - I followed closely an article on implementing redux and react-redux for state management. Since I didn't have a lot of experience in react I spent some time learning about redux and trying to create appropriate actions for the state manipulation.

## Summary

The project was a lot of fun and I learnt a lot of stuff. I need to finish working on the player vs computer.
